   <abstract>
     <t>This document describes a mechanism and packet format for
        allowing a Service Function Forwarder (SFF) to verify
        connectivity of an connected SFF or Service Function (SF).
     </t>
   </abstract>

   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>As described in Service Function Chaining (SFC) Architecture <xref target="RFC7665"/>,
        Service Function Forwarders (SFFs) are responsible for forwarding
        traffic to connected Service Functions (SFs).
     </t>
     <t>We believe there is a need for the SFFs to monitor connectivity to the SFs
        at the NSH layer.
       Rather than have the SFFs simply ping each SF's IP stack, we believe
       it is important to test NSH connectivity because the two protocols
       (IP and NSH) are often handled by different hardware or code modules.
     </t>
     <t>As an example, an SFF may wish to health-check multiple connected SFs
        prior to load-balancing NSH traffic to the SFs, having the
        means to automatically remove unreachable SFs from service.
     </t>
     <t>This document proposes an NSH OAM format allowing an SFF to request
        a neighboring SF to respond to an echo request via NSH encapsulation.
        This format can also be used for an SFF to request an neighboring SFF
        to respond to an echo request.
     </t>
     <t>Note that this connectivity checking is NOT to be confused with path verification.
        It is in fact a feature of this mechanism that no path forwarding needs
        to be configured to perform the connectivity verification.
     </t>
     <t>
        This document proposes use of the format of continuity check proposed in
        <xref target="I-D.ooamdt-rtgwg-demand-cc-cv"/> to be used within
        NSH frames for SFF-to-SF connectivity verification.

   <section title="SFF-SF Connectivity Verification">

   <t>
     An SFF may determine connectivity to an SF by means of 
     echo request/response. However, any two NSH nodes could
     verify connectivity by the following mechanism.
   </t>
   <t>
     By embedding the overlay ping packet format <xref target="I-D.ooamdt-rtgwg-demand-cc-cv"/> 
     within the OAM header <xref target="I-D.ooamdt-rtgwg-ooam-header"/>
     in NSH, the packet format is that of <xref target="fig_packet"/>.
     The MD-type 2 is shown, since no metadata is required.

       <t>Service Index: Should be set by sender to 255. Receiver should ignore it.</t>
       <t>V: OAM header version should be set by sender to 0 (?)</t>
       <t>Msg Type: value ? indicates OAM ping message follows the OAM header.</t>

       <t>Return Subcode: Unused at this time. MUST be ignored by initiator and responder.</t>
       <t>Sender's Handle: an arbitrary handle chosen by the initiator, to be echoed by the responder.
          This value is generally constant across requests and may be useful for
          identifying the initiator in a debugging situation.</t>
       <t>Sequence Number: a number chosen by the initiator, to be echoed by the responder.
          This value is generally incremeted by 1 between requests and may be useful
          for debugging packet loss counts.</t>
       <t>TLVs: The initiator may place any TLVs. The responder MUST
          echo back the TLVs verbatim unless TLVs are specifically
          defined otherwise.
          No OAM TLVs are required for this connectivity verification.
          However, (a) timestamp TLVs are expected to be useful for the sender
          to measure round-trip time; (b) large padding TLVs are expected to be
          useful for verifying MTU of a connection.</t>

   <section title="Echo Request Responder Behavior">
      <t>An NSH node receiving an echo request MUST do the following:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Clone the NSH packet and contents verbatim</t>
          <t>Change the Message Type from "Overlay Echo Request" to "Overlay Echo Reply" <xref target="I-D.ooamdt-rtgwg-demand-cc-cv"/></t>
          <t>Send the NSH packet back to the initiator using the transport the echo request
             was received on.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Note that for this type of OAM packet, the NSH packet is NOT forwarded
         according to path ID and service index, rather MUST be returned to the
         immediate peer. The echo is expected to work even when SFF forwarding tables
         are empty or incomplete.</t>
      <t>For example, an NSH packet transported directly over Ethernet MUST be
         returned to the MAC address from which it was received.
         As another example, an NSH packet received over UDP MUST be returned
         to the IP address and UDP port the were the source address and ports
         of the request.
      </t>
      <t>It might not be possible to use this OAM packet if there is not
         an obvious way to return the packet to the sender.</t>
